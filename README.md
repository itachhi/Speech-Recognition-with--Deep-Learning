# Speech-Recognition-with--Deep-Learning

I have written a research paper on the topic of "Speech Recognition with Deep Learning". The paper has been published in "Journal of Physics- Conference Series".

we perform speech information evaluation on speaker discriminated speech signals to hit upon the warmth of the person speakers involved inside the verbal exchange. we're analyzing exceptional techniques to perform speaker discrimination and speech evaluation to locate efficient algorithms to carry out this task.
